# Retail_Sales
ðŸ§¾ Overview

This project provides an end-to-end Retail Sales Data Analysis using SQL, demonstrating how structured queries can reveal key business insights from transactional data. The dataset models a retail environment containing information about stores, customers, products, and orders â€” enabling exploration of sales trends, customer behavior, and profitability.

The goal of this project is to showcase strong SQL analytical capabilities, including table creation, joins, aggregations, subqueries, and data transformations. The analysis answers real-world business questions such as total revenue by store, average order size by customer type, and profit margin by product.

The project also simulates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow, highlighting how data can be cleaned, standardized, and prepared for analysis using SQL logic and best practices in data engineering.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Understand Revenue Drivers: Calculate total sales and revenue by store, product, and region to identify top-performing locations.

Analyze Customer Behavior: Evaluate order frequency and average purchase quantity for Regular vs. VIP customers.

Profitability Insights: Determine profit margins across product categories to assess pricing strategy and efficiency.

Data Modeling & Schema Design: Design normalized tables (Stores, Customers, Products, Orders) and build SQL relationships using keys and constraints.

ETL Implementation:

Extract: Load raw data from CSV files.

Transform: Clean nulls, standardize categorical values, and calculate derived metrics like profit margin.

Load: Store transformed data into an SQL database (e.g., SQLite) for querying.

Business Reporting: Develop SQL queries that provide actionable insights through grouping, filtering, and aggregations.
